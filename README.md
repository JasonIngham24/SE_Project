## Goal Sum Even Fibbonaci Sequence Numbers API:

Our API allows an user to enter n which will be inputed locally into our "Compute System."

Then the API allows the output from the "Compute System" to be sent over a server to the "Storage System."

Then API will Allow the stored value to be returned to the user.

### Example Input/Output:

"Please Enter A Number You Want To Calculate Up To In The Fibbonaci Sequence"

***User** Intput:* 8

***Program** calculates up to 8th iteration of the Fibbonaci Sequence:* 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34

***Program** sums the even numbers in the sequence:* 2 + 8 + 34

***Program** outputs:* 44
